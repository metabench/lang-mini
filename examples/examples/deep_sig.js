/*
    Could include the expected results in the examples too.
    Would then make these functions easier to test as well.

    Defining mfp self-contained function?
    // Has no parameters?
    //  Save this idea.

    I'd paused for a while before starting mfp, it's now a lot clearer what API is needed.
    Don't add too much to it.
    Maybe do more on another module / function system that uses mfp and / or ofp.

    the ofp system may be worth doing more work on, making full? use of mfp?
    wrapping mfp functions, while also using mfp for its own implementation.
